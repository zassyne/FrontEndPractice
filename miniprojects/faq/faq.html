			<p class="question"">What is TEMPLATED?</p>
			<p class="answer" >TEMPLATED is a collection of free, Creative Commons-licensed CSS, HTML5, and responsive site templates, designed and built by Cherry, Doni, AJ, and occasionally our good friends Rafi (design) and Eduardo (code).</p>
			<p class="question">What is a Site Template?</p>
			<p class="answer">A starting point for a website. Usually consists of at least one or more HTML files, a stylesheet, and optionally a few support images and scripts. The HTML is where your content lives (eg. text and photos), while the rest of the stuff handles the presentation of that content. See this article for a great explanation on how this works.</p>
			<p class="question">What is a Responsive HTML5 Template?</p>
			<p class="answer">A special kind of site template that's 1. built on HTML5 (the latest HTML standard), and 2. designed to respond to the size of your screen and deliver the experience most optimal for it (whether it's a huge 30" desktop display or a 4" mobile phone). It does this by automatically switching between blocks of CSS rules that each target a specific range of screen sizes (commonly referred to as media queries).</p>
			<p class="question">How am I allowed to use them?</p>
			<p class="answer">All of our freebies are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license, so basically anything (even commercial stuff). The catch? Just give us a visible credit somewhere on the site (like a credits page or something)</p>
			<p class="question">What's a good app to work with these?</p>
			<p class="answer">Almost any text editor (eg. Notepad) will do the job, but a dedicated code editor like Atom or Sublime Text will offer a much richer experience and a ton of useful coding features (like syntax highlighting).</p>
			<p class="question">Which DOCTYPE should I use?</p>
			<p class="answer">If you are creating a new web page, the W3C recommend using HTML 4.01 Strict.
If you are trying to convert an ancient HTML 2.0 or HTML 3.2 document to the modern world, you can use HTML 4.01 Transitional until you have managed to transfer all presentational issues to CSS and all behavioural issues to JavaScript.</p>
<p class="question">What does character encoding (charset) mean?

</p>
			<p class="answer">Computers can only deal with numbers. What we see on the screen as letters or images are really just numeric codes, which the computer sees as groups of binary digits (ones and zeros).</p>
